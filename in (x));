     Display a legend for the current axes using the specified strings
     as labels.  Legend entries may be specified as individual character
     string arguments, a character array, or a cell array of character
     strings.  Legend works on line graphs, bar graphs, etc.  A plot
     must exist before legend is called.

     The optional parameter POS specifies the location of the legend as
     follows:

          north      center top
          south      center bottom
          east       right center
          west       left center
          northeast  right top (default)
          northwest  left top
          southeast  right bottom
          southwest  left bottom

          outside    can be appended to any location string

     Some specific functions are directly available using FUNC:

    "show"
          Show legends from the plot

    "hide"
    "off"
          Hide legends from the plot
